A Distortion Dice game targeted at kids. The 3 stats are Might, Magic, and Manners. Aspects will be what kind of princess you are, Assets will be your mount (dragon, horse, unicorn, griffon, etc) and what you wield (staff, scepter, sword, axe, etc).

Prismatic Princesses is a game about powerful princesses overcoming problems. Each princess will have a magic of some kind, usually defined by a theme related to their color. These things can be elemental, a fundamental aspect of the universe, or perhaps a more subtle kind of magic, such as dance or feats of strength. The game has no defined setting, aside from featuring a number of Princesses who have been gifted with magical power, and a responsibility to protect others, and lead them through darkness into the light. Each Princess wields their magic, as well as a powerful artifact, and has the help of a familiar that enhances or compliments their own abilities. While there is an included science fantasy setting, there is also a guide to creating your own setting as a group.

# Characters

The player characters in Prismatic Princesses are refered to as Princesses. However, they do not specifically have to be a princess. Princesses in this game are more of an idea than a gendered term, or a title of royalty. A Princess is someone blessed with a magical power related to a specific color. A Princess is someone who fights for good, who protects others, who believes in compassion, and wants to make the world a better place. The actual title of your Princess could be Princess, another royal title like Duchess or Prince, Something made up like Light Bringers, or maybe each Princess has a super-hero like name.

# Playing the Game

First, select the die for the stat that you want to use for your action. Then add the dice for any assets or aspects that can be used. Roll them and keep only the highest die.
The Narrator will select the harm die that matches your stat (if you use Might they will use the Might harm die). Then the narrator will add your struggle die it it makes sense, and finally the narrator will add a die for the challenge you are up against. 
The narrator rolls and also takes the highest die. If your die is higher than the narrators, you succeed, if your die is 5 or more, you get a success with a bonus, if you tie, you get a partial success, and if your die is lower, you get a failure.


# Setting

## Iridesia

The included setting of Prismatic Princesses is the world of Iridesia. A land once occupied by a powerful people who abandoned this planet, leaving behind advanced technology that few can even begin to understand. Iridesia is comprised of many lands of varying colors, and is currently suffering from a corruption of shards that are alien in nature. These shards absorb the color out of things near them, corrupting them, and throwing off the harmony of the world. This creates violence and chaos near where the shards have landed.
