# Plucky Princesses

A Distortion Dice game targeted at kids. The 3 stats are Might, Magic, and Manners. Aspects will be what kind of princess you are, Assets will be your mount (dragon, horse, unicorn, griffon, etc) and what you wield (staff, scepter, sword, axe, etc).

This is a game about magical princesses (or princes, or dukes, or whatever title you prefer) who face challenges and must save the day. It is intended to have a fantasy setting that you can build with your players, and it's inspired by Perils & Princesses, Princess World, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, and the many works of fiction about princesses in challenging situations.

There is a [Google Sheets Character Keeper](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DIalMaBtRqMXCNJUHo8jZ_xfP-EjSXnuGzIGj_Hlg7A/edit?usp=sharing) available if you would like to keep track of your characters digitally

As a distortion dice game, this is based on the same system used in [Distorted Domains](https://pennylescroche.github.io/Distorted-Domains). Please look at Distorted Domains if there are any questions on how the system works or how to run the game

## Actions

First, select the die for the stat that you want to use for your action. Then add the dice for any assets or aspects that can be used. Roll them and keep only the highest die.
The Narrator will select the harm die that matches your stat (if you use Might they will use the Might harm die). Then the narrator will add your struggle die it it makes sense, and finally the narrator will add a die for the challenge you are up against. 
The narrator rolls and also takes the highest die. If your die is higher than the narrators, you succeed, if your die is 5 or more, you get a success with a bonus, if you tie, you get a partial success, and if your die is lower, you get a failure.
